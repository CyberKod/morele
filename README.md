This is a project created for recruitment purposes. This simple application is designed to:
1. Returning three random titles
2. Returning all movies starting with the letter W, but only if they have an even number of characters in the title
3. Returning all titles that consist of more than one word

To run this application we need to run it in the command line (PHP 8.2 recommended):
<br>`php composer.phar install`

Then we can simply start our local server, e.g.:
<br>`php -S 127.0.0.1:8000`

Just open the URL below in our web browser:
<br>http://127.0.0.1:8000/
